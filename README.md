# motion_detection
This program detects any object that enters the video frame. The size of the object should be greater than a certain threshold.
The program also generates a csv file detailing the time of entry and exit of the object.
A potential application of this program can be in wild-life photography where the camera can store pictures of any animal that enters the video frame and take a note of the time.
